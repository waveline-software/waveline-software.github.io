            <p class="lead">There is only one person on our team currently, <a href="https://github.com/sykeben"><img class="inline-avatar" src="img/avatars/sykeben-small.png"> Sykeben</a>. He does everything from software development, to creating this very website.</p>
            <p>We are looking to eventually expand this team in the future. When the company is ready to begin fully doing business, any openings for needed positions will be listed here. If you are looking to join, check back periodically for any listings of open positions that may interest you.</p>

            <p class="lead">After sitting dormant for a long time, the company is beginning to take shape.</p>
            <p>As you read this page, our team is working on creating branding elements, meeting legal requirements, negotiating license agreements, and more so we can begin to develop new software. As the company grows, updates will be posted here and more products will appear. For now we are still in the planning stage, and are working on bringing the company to life after sitting still since last March.</p>
